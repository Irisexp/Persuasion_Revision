2. True or False.  The higher the probability the sender chooses to send a red message if the ball is blue, the less likely that the color of the drawn ball is red following a red message<br>
&#9745 True<br>
False<br>

<br>

Consider the two extreme cases.
<br>
If the sender chooses to send a red message 0% and a blue message 100% when the drawn ball is blue, the sender is always truthfully revealing the color of the ball, so the ball is definitely red following a red message.
<br>
If the sender chooses to send a red message 100% and a blue message 0% when the drawn ball is blue, then the probability of a ball being red following a red message is only 1/3.
